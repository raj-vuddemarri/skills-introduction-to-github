<h2 class="science">Study on India's contribution to satellite technology through projects like GSAT or NaviC</h2>
<p><big> India has made significant contributions to satellite technology which are:<br>
<h2 class="sci"><b><i><u>Launch Vehicles-</i></b></u><br></h2>
A launch vehicle is typically a rocket powered vehicle designed to carry a satellite or spacecraft from the Earth's atmosphere to the outer space. India has 
developed launch vehicles to place satellites into the Earth's orbit. <b> INDIA'S SPACE RESEARCH ORGANIZATION (ISRO)</b> has developed several launch 
vehicles which include :<br>
1. Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle:- It has launched satellites and spacecrafts for India and foreign countries. <br>
2.Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV):- GSLV can carry heavier payloads etc.<br>
India has made significant contributions to satellite technology even through projects like GSAT and NaviC they are: <br>
<h2 class="sci"><b><i><u> Communication </u></i></b></h2>
The GSAT series of satellites support communication which includes services such as television broadcasting, DTH television, telecommunication, and 
radio networking.The GSAT-11 satellite was the heaviest satellite built by ISRO and provided multi-spot beam antenna coverage over India. <br>
<h2 class ="sci"><u><i><b>Navigation</b></i></u></h2>
The NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation) system provides positioning, navigation, and timing services for India and the surrounding region. 
It's more suitable for Indian terrain and works better in India's tropical climate than other GPS. India's navigation satellites, also known as the Indian
 Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) or NavIC, help with navigation in several ways.

<h2 class ="sci"><i><u><b>Weather Prediction</b></u></i></h2>
Satellites are a critical tool for weather prediction in India, providing information on a variety of weather conditions, including:<br>
Cloud Cover<br>
Temperature<br>
Precipitation<br>
Wind<br>
Tropical Cyclones<br>
India uses both domestic and foreign satellites for weather forecasting. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is responsible for the
 launch and operation of these satellites. The data from these satellites is processed in the INSAT Meteorological Data Processing (IMDPS) system
 to generate images and products. 
<h2 class="sci"><u><i><b>Disaster Management</b></i></u></h2>
Satellites are used in India to help manage disasters in several ways, including:<br>
<b>Providing Real Time Data</b>:- Satellites provide real-time data and imagery to help with disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. <br>
<b>Predicting and Preventing Disasters:-</b> Satellites can detect changes in ocean temperatures, wind speeds, and cloud formations, which can 
help meteorologists issue early warnings. <br>
Creating maps and planning</b>:- Relief organizations use satellite images to create maps, plan evacuation routes, and allocate relief resources. <br>
These all things and information provided by satellites and the ISRO department are really helpful to prepare for and manage natural disasters easily
and prevent high damage.<br>
